# Smart Agents, Stupid Simple: Build a Sidekick with .NET

This repo contains the code and slides for the session "Smart Agents, Stupid Simple: Build a Sidekick with .NET".

## Welcome

Welcome to the session repo. The slides will be available via GitHub Pages soon.

## Slides

The slides are built with [Slidev](https://sli.dev/).

## Demo

The demo code is in the `src/Dusty` folder. The CLI project is the main project that you'd wan to run. I will
add more details, but for the adventurous, look for a Secrets.cs file if you want to run external models. Run an Ollama
server locally to test the first two local demos.
