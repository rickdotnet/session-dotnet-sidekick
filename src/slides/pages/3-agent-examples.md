- Saves you from manual copy-paste and browser hops

**Task Automator**:
- Agents handle repetitive tasks. 
- “Log 2 hours for client X.”
- All about that time saving

**Data Whisperer**:
- Agents dig through data and give answers.
- Pull time logs, summarizes them, and generates a Markdown report for your boss.
- No need to write SQL or open Excel.
