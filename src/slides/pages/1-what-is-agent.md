Notes
- works well
- not AI scoped

Too broad and doesn't fit the theme.

## an AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment

If that was too broad, this is too narrow.

I think agents are simpler than that.

## Itâ€™s an LLM, a loop, and enough tokens

*[Thorsten Ball](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent)*

I recently came across an article, which I've link with his name, but I'll also link on a further slide.

And at the end of the day, he's right. An agent is what you make it. Simple or complex.

# What's an Agent?

<!--
One of the bits of feedback I got from the dry run was... 

**I'm still not sure what an agent is or how
it differs from a regular application.**

This is an agent without an LLM, but it still has a loop and can do things.
- it can read files
- it can write files
- it can call APIs

# What's an Agent?

And here's an agent with an LLM.
- it can read files
- it can write files
- it can call APIs

The only difference is that it has an LLM in the loop.

# What's an Agent?

<!--
At the end of the day, how the system is composed and the functions it provides IS the agent.

The only thing stopping your agent from talking to your thermostat is you... and good judgment.

The agent is more than just the loop, there are different entry points and a lot of indirection... but the box in the middle is a pretty good way to break down what's really happening.

For the purposes of this talk, we're going to call that box, Dusty.
